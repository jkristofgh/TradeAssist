# Extension: Execute Specific Extension Phase from Comprehensive PRP

## Usage: ext-3-execute-prp [COMPREHENSIVE_PRP_PATH] --phase [PHASE_NUMBER]

Executes a specific implementation phase from the comprehensive extension PRP, using phase-specific requirements extracted by ext-2-plan-phases and full codebase context.

## Purpose

This command implements a specific extension phase using the comprehensive PRP as the complete technical guide while focusing on the deliverables defined for the specified phase. It leverages the complete understanding from the comprehensive PRP while executing only the current phase scope.

## Usage Examples
```bash
/ext-3-execute-prp PRP-EXTENSIONS/EXT_HistoricalDataFoundation/planning/extension-prp-historicaldata-20241215-143022.md --phase 1
