## Technical Architecture Delivered

### Database Decorator Framework

```python
# Before: 15+ lines of boilerplate per method
async def old_method(self, instrument_id: int):
    async with get_db_session() as session:
        try:
            # Validate instrument...
            # Business logic...
            await session.commit()
        except Exception as e:
            await session.rollback()
            # Error handling...

# After: 3 decorator lines + pure business logic  
@with_db_session
@with_validated_instrument
@handle_db_errors("Operation name")
async def new_method(self, session: AsyncSession, instrument: Instrument):
    # Pure business logic only!
```

### Strategy Pattern Infrastructure

```python
# Before: 98-line monolithic method
async def _calculate_indicator(self, indicator_type, market_data, instrument_id):
    # 98 lines of mixed responsibilities...

# After: Focused strategies + context management
class RSIStrategy(IndicatorStrategy):
    async def calculate(self, market_data, instrument_id, **params):
        # 15 lines of focused RSI calculation
        
# Usage: 1 line delegation
return await self.indicator_calculator.calculate_indicator(type, data, id, **params)
```
