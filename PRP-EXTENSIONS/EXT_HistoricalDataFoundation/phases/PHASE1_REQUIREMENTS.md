# Extension Phase 1 Requirements - Foundation

## Phase Overview
- **Phase Number**: 1
- **Phase Name**: Foundation (Database, Service & API)
- **Extension Name**: Historical Data Foundation
- **Dependencies**: None (foundational phase)

## Phase Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Establish complete database schema for historical market data storage
- Build robust service layer with external API integration 
- Create comprehensive REST API with validation and error handling
- Integrate service into existing TradeAssist lifecycle management

### Deliverables
- MarketDataBar, DataSource, and DataQuery database models with migrations
- HistoricalDataService with Schwab API integration and circuit breaker
- Complete historical data REST API with comprehensive validation
- Service registration in main application lifecycle

## Existing System Context
### Available Integration Points (from CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Database Models**: `src/backend/models/base.py` - Base class with TimestampMixin for consistent model patterns
- **Service Architecture**: `src/backend/services/` - Established async service patterns with lifecycle management
- **API Router Pattern**: `src/backend/api/` - FastAPI routers with `/api/v1/` prefix following established patterns
- **Database Connection**: `src/backend/database/connection.py` - Async SQLite connection management with session handling
- **Schwab Integration**: `src/backend/integrations/schwab_client.py` - Existing Schwab API wrapper for extension

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Service Pattern**: Async services with start/stop lifecycle, background task management, and circuit breaker integration
- **Database Pattern**: SQLAlchemy models inheriting from Base with TimestampMixin, async sessions, and relationship handling
- **API Pattern**: FastAPI routers with Pydantic validation, proper error handling, and OpenAPI documentation
- **Configuration Pattern**: Pydantic-settings for environment variables with validation and type hints

### APIs and Services Available
- **SchwabClient**: `/src/backend/integrations/schwab_client.py` - API wrapper for historical data retrieval
- **CircuitBreakerService**: `/src/backend/services/circuit_breaker.py` - Resilience patterns for external API calls
- **Database Sessions**: `/src/backend/database/connection.py` - Async session management with proper cleanup

## Phase Implementation Requirements
### Backend Requirements
- **Database Models** (`src/backend/models/historical_data.py`):
  - `MarketDataBar` model with OHLCV data, metadata fields, and futures support
  - `DataSource` model for tracking data providers and their configurations
  - `DataQuery` model for storing and reusing user queries
  - Proper indexes for time-series query performance: symbol+timestamp, symbol+frequency
  - Unique constraints to prevent duplicate data storage
  
- **Database Migration** (`alembic/versions/`):
  - Create comprehensive migration for all new tables
  - Add performance indexes for time-series data access patterns
  - Include rollback capability and constraint validation
  
- **Service Layer** (`src/backend/services/historical_data_service.py`):
  - Complete HistoricalDataService with async lifecycle management
  - Integration with existing SchwabClient for data retrieval
  - Circuit breaker implementation for external API reliability
  - Data aggregation capabilities for higher timeframes
  - Cache management for frequently accessed data
  - Background maintenance tasks for data cleanup and statistics

- **API Endpoints** (`src/backend/api/historical_data.py`):
  - `/api/v1/historical-data/fetch` - Primary data retrieval endpoint
  - `/api/v1/historical-data/frequencies` - Supported frequency options
  - `/api/v1/historical-data/queries/save` - Save query configurations
  - `/api/v1/historical-data/queries/load` - Load saved queries
  - `/api/v1/historical-data/sources` - Data source information
  - Comprehensive Pydantic request/response models with validation
  - Proper error handling and status code management

### Frontend Requirements  
- **No frontend requirements for Phase 1** - Foundation phase focuses on backend infrastructure
- **API Integration Preparation**: Ensure API endpoints are properly documented for Phase 2 frontend development

### Integration Requirements
- **Service Registration**: Register HistoricalDataService in `src/backend/main.py` lifespan manager
- **Router Integration**: Add historical data router to main FastAPI application
- **Database Integration**: Ensure models are properly integrated with existing database connection management
- **Configuration Integration**: Add necessary environment variables to existing configuration system

## Compatibility Requirements
### Backward Compatibility
- All existing API endpoints and functionality must remain unchanged
- Database schema additions must not affect existing tables or performance
- Service integration must not impact existing service startup/shutdown processes

### API Contract Preservation
- Maintain all existing `/api/v1/` endpoint contracts
- New endpoints follow established patterns for consistency
- Error response formats consistent with existing API design
- OpenAPI documentation generation for new endpoints

## Testing Requirements
### Integration Testing
- Database model integration with existing Base class and TimestampMixin
- Service lifecycle integration with existing application startup/shutdown
- API router integration with main FastAPI application
- Schwab API integration with circuit breaker and error handling

### Functionality Testing
- Database CRUD operations for all new models
- Service data retrieval from Schwab API with various parameters
- API endpoint validation with valid and invalid request data
- Data aggregation functionality for different timeframes
- Cache management and expiration logic

### Compatibility Testing
- Existing database functionality unaffected by new schema
- Existing service startup/shutdown processes work with new service
- Existing API endpoints continue to function normally
- Application performance not degraded by new service integration

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Database models created with proper indexes and constraints
- [ ] Service successfully retrieves historical data from Schwab API
- [ ] API endpoints respond correctly with comprehensive validation
- [ ] Service integrates seamlessly with application lifecycle
- [ ] All existing system functionality remains intact
- [ ] Database migration runs successfully forward and backward
- [ ] Circuit breaker protects against external API failures
- [ ] Cache management improves query response times
- [ ] Unit test coverage >90% for all new components

## Phase Completion Definition
This phase is complete when:
- [ ] All database models are implemented and migrated successfully
- [ ] HistoricalDataService retrieves and stores market data correctly
- [ ] All API endpoints function with proper validation and error handling
- [ ] Service is registered and managed by application lifecycle
- [ ] Integration tests pass for all new functionality
- [ ] Existing system functionality verified through regression testing
- [ ] Performance impact assessment shows acceptable overhead
- [ ] Code follows established TradeAssist patterns and conventions
- [ ] API documentation is generated and accurate

## Next Phase Preparation
