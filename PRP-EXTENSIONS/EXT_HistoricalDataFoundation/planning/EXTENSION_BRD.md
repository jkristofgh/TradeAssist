# Extension Business Requirements Document Template

## Extension Overview

* **Extension Name**: Historical Data Extension
* **Target Project**: TradeAssist (internal trading analytics app)
* **Extension Type**: Feature Enhancement
* **Version**: v0.1 (Draft)

## Extension Objectives

### Primary Goals

* Enable users to pull **historical market data** for **stocks, indexes, and futures**.
* Support **flexible parameters** (frequency, date range, relative ranges).
* Store data at the **lowest available granularity** and provide **higher-timeframe aggregation**.

### Success Criteria

* Users can retrieve historical data for any in-scope symbol and timeframe **without gaps on valid sessions**.
* **Aggregated series** (e.g., 5m/1h/1d) match deterministic aggregation of the stored base series.
* Users can **preview in UI** for data analysis and visualization.

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

* **Historical Retrieval (Equities/Indexes/Futures)**: Pull OHLCV bars for selected symbols over a specified date range and frequency.
* **Timeframe Aggregation**: Provide higher timeframes (e.g., 5m, 30m, 1h, 1d, 1w) calculated from stored lowest-level bars.
* **UI Pull & Display**: Simple UI to configure queries, preview tabular results, and show a quick chart.

### User Workflows

* **Workflow 1: Pull Historical Data**

  1. Open Historical Data panel.
  2. Select **Asset Class** (Stocks, Indexes, Futures).
  3. Enter **Symbol(s)**.
  4. Choose **Date Range** (Start/End or presets: Back X days/months, YTD, Last N bars).
  5. Choose **Frequency** (1m, 5m, 10m, 30m, 1h, 1d, 2d, 1w).
  6. (Futures only) Select **continuous series** and **roll policy/adjustment** if offered.
  7. Click **Preview** to view table and quick chart.
* **Workflow 2: Save & Re-Run Query (optional)**

  1. After a successful preview, click **Save Query** and name it.
  2. From **Saved Queries**, select a saved item and click **Run** to reproduce results.

## Integration Requirements

### Existing System Integration

* **Integration Point 1**: Charts module consumes returned bar series for visualization (no indicator computations in this scope).
* **Integration Point 2**: Indicators module consumes bar series as inputs (formulas/outcomes out of scope).

### Data Requirements

* **Data Sources**: Market data provider(s) for equities, indexes, and futures (vendor selection out of scope).
* **Data Storage**: Persist at **lowest level** available (target: 1-minute for intraday markets; daily where intraday unavailable); store adjustment flags/metadata.
* **Data Flow**: User query → fetch/serve base bars → compute aggregation (if requested) → return dataset with metadata → render table/chart.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Compatibility

* **Backward Compatibility**: Must not alter existing chart/indicator inputs or break current symbol formats.
* **API Compatibility**: Maintain existing read endpoints and response shape; add parameters in a backward-compatible manner.

### User Experience

* **UI Consistency**: Follow existing design system (components, spacing, labels, empty/error states).
* **User Workflow Integration**: Access via a single **Historical Data** entry point; results align with current user expectations.

## Constraints and Assumptions

### Technical Constraints

* Market calendars/holidays must be respected; no bars on closed sessions.
* Vendor lookback limits and rate limits may constrain maximum range or batch size.

### Business Constraints

* **Options data is out of scope** for this release.
* Data licensing restrictions apply (internal analysis only).

### Assumptions

* Users know valid symbols/tickers.
* Timezone labeling is consistent and explicit (e.g., UTC or Exchange Local).

## Out of Scope

* Options (equity or futures) data and chains.
* Real-time streaming, alerts, backtesting, and order execution.
* Vendor selection, ETL/infra specifics, and caching strategies.
* Advanced chart types and indicator definitions.

## Acceptance Criteria

* [ ] Given symbol(s), frequency, and date range, system returns **gap-free OHLCV** for valid sessions.
* [ ] **Aggregated** timeframes match deterministic aggregation of stored lowest-level data for the same range.
* [ ] **Continuous futures** (if selected) return a single series with roll/adjustment metadata included.
* [ ] **UI Preview** shows a sortable table and a quick chart for the requested series.
* [ ] Integration with existing system maintains all current functionality.
* [ ] Extension follows existing system patterns and conventions.
