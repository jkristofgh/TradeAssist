# Extension Business Requirements Document

## Extension Overview
- **Extension Name**: Database Performance & Integrity
- **Target Project**: TradeAssist
- **Extension Type**: Infrastructure/Performance Optimization
- **Version**: 1.0

## Extension Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Eliminate performance bottlenecks in database operations
- Protect against accidental data loss through dangerous CASCADE DELETE
- Optimize database for high-frequency market data ingestion
- Establish production-ready database architecture for scalability

### Success Criteria
- 30-50% improvement in INSERT operation performance for market data
- 2-3x faster price calculations through DECIMAL to FLOAT conversion
- Zero risk of accidental historical data deletion
- Database capable of handling 10,000+ market data inserts per minute
- Query performance maintained or improved after index optimization
- Time-series data partitioning enables long-term data retention without degradation

## Functional Requirements
### Core Features
- **Index Optimization**: 
  - Reduce MarketData table from 5 indexes to 2 essential indexes
  - Reduce AlertLog table from 11 indexes to 4 essential indexes
  - Maintain query performance while dramatically improving INSERT speed
  - Analyze query patterns to determine optimal index strategy

- **Data Type Optimization**:
  - Convert all price fields from DECIMAL(12,4) to FLOAT for performance
  - Maintain DECIMAL only for accounting/settlement operations requiring precision
  - Update all calculation logic to handle FLOAT arithmetic
  - Ensure backward compatibility in API responses

- **Referential Integrity Safety**:
  - Replace all CASCADE DELETE with RESTRICT to prevent accidental data loss
  - Implement soft delete mechanism for logical data removal
  - Add `deleted_at` timestamp columns for audit trail
  - Create administrative procedures for safe data cleanup

### Database Architecture Improvements
- **Time-Series Partitioning**:
  - Implement monthly partitioning for MarketData table
  - Implement quarterly partitioning for AlertLog table
  - Create automated partition management procedures
  - Establish data archival strategy for old partitions

- **Connection Pool Optimization**:
  - Configure optimal pool size for high-frequency trading workload
  - Implement connection monitoring and health checks
  - Optimize connection lifecycle management
  - Add connection pool metrics and alerting

## Integration Requirements
### Existing System Integration
- **ORM Integration**: All SQLAlchemy models must be updated to reflect schema changes
- **Migration Strategy**: Zero-downtime migration plan for production deployment
- **Application Layer**: Update all services to handle new data types and relationships
- **Monitoring Integration**: Database performance metrics integration with existing monitoring

### Data Requirements
- **Data Migration**: Safe migration of existing DECIMAL data to FLOAT
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation during and after migration
- **Data Backup**: Full backup strategy before any schema modifications
- **Data Integrity**: Maintain data consistency throughout migration process

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Performance
- **INSERT Performance**: Target 30-50% improvement in high-frequency data insertion
- **Query Performance**: Maintain or improve current query response times
- **Calculation Performance**: 2-3x faster price calculations with FLOAT arithmetic
- **Scalability**: Support for 10x current data volume without performance degradation

### Reliability
- **Data Safety**: Zero tolerance for accidental data loss
- **Migration Safety**: Rollback plan for all database changes
- **Connection Stability**: Improved connection pool management for better reliability
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive metrics for database health and performance

## Constraints and Assumptions
### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility in API responses during transition
- Cannot afford extended downtime for large table migrations
- Must preserve all historical data integrity during migration
- Database changes must be reversible through migration scripts

### Business Constraints  
- Critical performance improvements needed before production scaling
- Zero data loss tolerance for financial trading data
- Must complete within 2-3 week timeline to unblock other extensions
- Cannot impact live trading operations during business hours

### Assumptions
- Development and staging environments accurately reflect production data volumes
- Database administrator expertise available for complex migration procedures
- Adequate testing time available for performance validation
- Monitoring systems can be updated to track new performance metrics

## Out of Scope
- Application logic changes beyond data type handling (covered in Extension 1)
- New database features or tables (focus is on optimizing existing schema)
- Frontend changes related to data handling (covered in Extension 3)
- Real-time data processing optimizations beyond database layer
- External database systems or data warehouse integration
