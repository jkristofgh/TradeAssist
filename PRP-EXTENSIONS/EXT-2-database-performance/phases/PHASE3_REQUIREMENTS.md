### Service Integration
```python
# New service classes to implement
- PartitionManagerService (automated partition management)
- PartitionHealthMonitor (partition-specific monitoring)
- DataArchivalService (automated archival and cleanup)

# Enhanced existing services
- DatabaseMonitoringService (partition metrics integration)
- OptimizedMarketDataRepository (partition-aware operations)

# Partition management functions
- create_market_data_partition()
- create_alert_log_partition()
- cleanup_old_partitions()
- archive_partition_data()
```

### Configuration Requirements
- **Partition Settings**: Retention periods, archival policies, creation schedules
- **Monitoring Settings**: Partition health thresholds and alerting configuration
- **Storage Settings**: Archival storage paths and compression options
- **Performance Settings**: Partition operation timing and resource limits

## Compatibility Requirements
### Backward Compatibility
