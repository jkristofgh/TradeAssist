    - Monitoring: No bulk operation support

After Phase 2:
  Market Data Insertion:
    - Method: Bulk INSERT with batch processing
    - Throughput: 10,000+ records/minute (20x improvement)
    - Latency: ~6ms per record (20x improvement)
    - Monitoring: Real-time performance tracking
    - Batch Processing: Configurable batch sizes (1000 default)
```
