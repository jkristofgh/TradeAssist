# Extension Phase 2 Requirements - Enhanced Service Layer

## Phase Overview
- **Phase Number**: 2
- **Phase Name**: Enhanced Service Layer
- **Extension Name**: Database Performance & Integrity
- **Dependencies**: Phase 1 database schema foundation with optimized indexes and data types

## Phase Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Update model classes to leverage Phase 1 database optimizations
- Implement enhanced repository patterns for high-performance bulk operations
- Optimize connection pool configuration for high-frequency trading workloads
- Integrate soft delete mechanism into service layer patterns

### Deliverables
- Updated MarketData and AlertLog model classes with FLOAT types and soft delete
- OptimizedMarketDataRepository with bulk insert capabilities
- DatabaseMonitoringService for connection pool health tracking
- SoftDeleteMixin integrated into existing model patterns
- Enhanced service layer with performance optimization integration

## Existing System Context
### Available Integration Points (from CODEBASE_ANALYSIS.md)
- **Service Layer Pattern**: AlertEngine, HistoricalDataService, AnalyticsEngine patterns
- **Repository Pattern**: Existing SQLAlchemy async repository patterns
- **Dependency Injection**: FastAPI dependencies for service integration
- **Connection Management**: Existing async session management and connection pooling

### Existing Patterns to Follow
- **Service Class Pattern**: Follow existing service lifecycle management (start/stop methods)
- **Repository Pattern**: Use existing async session management with selectinload
- **Model Pattern**: Inherit from Base and TimestampMixin following existing conventions
- **Error Handling**: Use structured logging and async session rollback patterns

### APIs and Services Available
- **Database Session**: `get_db_session()` async context manager from Phase 1
- **Base Models**: Phase 1 SoftDeleteMixin ready for integration
- **Existing Services**: AlertEngine, HistoricalDataService for integration patterns
