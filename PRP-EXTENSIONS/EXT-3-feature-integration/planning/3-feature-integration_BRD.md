# Extension Business Requirements Document

## Extension Overview
- **Extension Name**: Feature Integration & API Completion
- **Target Project**: TradeAssist
- **Extension Type**: Feature Enhancement/Integration
- **Version**: 1.0

## Extension Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Bridge critical backend-frontend communication gaps
- Make analytics features accessible to users through complete API integration
- Ensure type safety and data consistency across the full stack
- Establish reliable real-time data communication

### Success Criteria
- All 11 analytics backend endpoints accessible from frontend
- Zero type safety violations between backend and frontend models
- Real-time WebSocket data streaming operates reliably without message loss
- Authentication flow fully functional with Schwab OAuth integration
- Historical data service fully integrated with type-safe frontend interface
- 100% of backend features accessible through frontend UI

## Functional Requirements
### Core Features
- **Analytics API Frontend Integration**: 
  - Add 11 missing analytics endpoints to frontend apiClient
  - Implement market analysis, real-time indicators, price prediction UI access
  - Create risk metrics, stress testing, volume profile frontend methods
  - Enable correlation matrix and market microstructure analysis from UI

- **Response Model Alignment**:
  - Synchronize backend `AlertRuleResponse` with frontend `AlertRule` types
  - Add missing `instrument_symbol` field to frontend models
  - Standardize field naming conventions (snake_case backend, camelCase frontend)
  - Implement proper type transformations in API client

- **WebSocket Message Standardization**:
  - Replace generic `Dict[str, Any]` backend messages with typed structures
  - Implement proper message validation on both ends
  - Standardize datetime serialization to ISO format
  - Add message versioning for future compatibility

### User Workflows
- **Analytics Dashboard Access**: Users can access all technical analysis features through UI
- **Real-time Data Monitoring**: Users receive live market updates without connection drops
- **Schwab Authentication**: Users can authenticate with Schwab API through integrated OAuth flow
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Users can query and analyze historical data with full type safety

## Integration Requirements
### Existing System Integration
- **Frontend API Client**: Extend existing apiClient with analytics methods
- **Backend Analytics Services**: Maintain existing service interfaces while ensuring frontend compatibility
- **WebSocket Infrastructure**: Upgrade existing WebSocket handling for better reliability
- **Authentication System**: Integrate Schwab OAuth flow into existing auth architecture

### Data Requirements
- **Type Consistency**: All data models synchronized between backend and frontend
- **Real-time Data Flow**: WebSocket messages properly typed and validated
- **Authentication Tokens**: Secure token management for Schwab API integration
- **Error Handling**: Consistent error message formats across all integrations

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Compatibility
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing maintained across full stack
- **API Compatibility**: All new integrations follow existing API patterns
- **WebSocket Reliability**: Connection stability with automatic reconnection
- **Authentication Security**: Secure handling of OAuth tokens and credentials

### User Experience
- **Feature Accessibility**: All backend analytics features available through intuitive UI
- **Real-time Responsiveness**: WebSocket updates render within 50ms target
- **Error Feedback**: Clear, user-friendly error messages for all failure scenarios
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators for all asynchronous operations

## Constraints and Assumptions
### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing frontend components
- Cannot modify core backend service logic (handled in Extension 1)
- WebSocket message format changes must be coordinated between teams
- Authentication integration must comply with Schwab API requirements

### Business Constraints  
- Analytics features are critical for user value proposition
- Real-time data reliability essential for trading application
- Must complete within 2-3 weeks to unblock user-facing features
- Authentication integration required for production deployment

### Assumptions
- Backend analytics services are stable and well-tested (after Extension 1)
- WebSocket infrastructure can handle message format changes
- Frontend development team available for integration work
- Schwab API credentials and OAuth setup available for testing

## Out of Scope
- New analytics algorithms or calculations (focus is on accessibility)
- Database schema changes (covered in Extension 2)
- Backend service refactoring (covered in Extension 1)
- UI/UX design changes beyond integration requirements
- Performance optimizations beyond data transfer efficiency
