- NotificationService: 30 lines eliminated
- UserPreferencesService: 20 lines eliminated
- PerformanceMonitoringService: 30 lines eliminated
- Additional services: ~114 lines eliminated

**Total Expected Reduction**: **345+ lines of boilerplate eliminated**

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Service Refactoring Approach

#### Systematic Refactoring Process:
1. **Service Analysis**: Review each service for decorator application opportunities
2. **Method Identification**: Identify all methods with database session patterns
3. **Decorator Application**: Apply appropriate decorator combinations
4. **Testing Validation**: Ensure identical behavior after refactoring
5. **Performance Validation**: Confirm no performance degradation

#### Decorator Selection Strategy:
```python
# Pattern 1: Simple database operation
@with_db_session
async def simple_db_operation(self, session: AsyncSession, param: str) -> result:
    """Use for basic database operations without special requirements"""

# Pattern 2: Operations requiring instrument validation  
@with_db_session
@with_validated_instrument
async def instrument_operation(self, session: AsyncSession, instrument: Instrument, param: str) -> result:
    """Use for operations that need instrument validation and injection"""

# Pattern 3: Operations with custom error handling
@with_db_session
@handle_db_errors("Custom operation description")
async def error_handled_operation(self, session: AsyncSession, param: str) -> result:
    """Use for operations requiring custom error context"""

# Pattern 4: Full decorator stack
@with_db_session
@with_validated_instrument  
@handle_db_errors("Complex operation with instrument")
async def complex_operation(self, session: AsyncSession, instrument: Instrument, param: str) -> result:
    """Use for complex operations needing all decorator benefits"""
```

### 2. Service Compliance Validation

#### 500-Line Rule Compliance Check:
```python
# Pre-refactoring service sizes (estimated from PRP analysis):
AlertEngine: ~580 lines → Target: <500 lines (24 lines eliminated + structure cleanup)
RiskCalculator: ~645 lines → Target: <500 lines (43 lines eliminated + method extraction)  
DataIngestionService: ~720 lines → Target: <500 lines (51 lines eliminated + component extraction)
MLModelService: ~520 lines → Target: <500 lines (33 lines eliminated)
NotificationService: ~485 lines → Already compliant (30 lines eliminated = buffer)
UserPreferencesService: ~380 lines → Already compliant (20 lines eliminated = improvement)
PerformanceMonitoringService: ~465 lines → Already compliant (30 lines eliminated = improvement)
```

**Additional Refactoring Required**:
- Services exceeding 500 lines after decorator application will require additional method extraction
- Follow patterns established in Phase 3 (HistoricalDataService decomposition)
- Create helper classes or utility modules for extracted functionality
