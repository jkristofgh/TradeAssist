# Architecture Foundation Extension - Implementation-Driven Phase Plan

## Extension Overview
- **Extension Name**: Code Architecture Foundation
- **Target Project**: TradeAssist
- **Extension Version**: 1.0.0
- **Implementation Strategy**: Progressive refactoring with minimal risk
- **Phase Plan Generated**: 2025-08-31

## Technical Complexity Analysis

### Current Architecture Challenges
Based on comprehensive PRP analysis, the following technical complexities drive phase boundaries:

**Primary Refactoring Targets:**
1. **HistoricalDataService** (1,424 lines) - Violates Single Responsibility Principle
2. **AnalyticsEngine._calculate_indicator** (98-line god method) - Violates Open/Closed Principle  
3. **Database Session Boilerplate** (345+ lines across 23 methods) - Violates DRY Principle
4. **Service Class Size Violations** (Multiple classes exceed 500-line limit)

**Implementation Complexity Factors:**
- **Database Integration Complexity**: Medium (requires careful session management)
- **API Backward Compatibility**: High (zero-tolerance for breaking changes)
- **Performance Preservation**: High (must maintain <2s response times)
- **Component Interdependencies**: Medium (services have established communication patterns)

## Natural Phase Boundaries

### Technical Workflow Analysis
The comprehensive PRP reveals natural implementation boundaries based on:

1. **Dependency Chain**: Database decorators → Strategy patterns → Service decomposition → Integration
2. **Risk Mitigation**: Foundation first, then progressive complexity increase
3. **Testing Strategy**: Each phase provides complete, testable functionality
4. **Rollback Capability**: Each phase can be independently deployed or reverted
