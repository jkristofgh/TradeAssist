# Extension Business Requirements Document

## Extension Overview
- **Extension Name**: Code Architecture Foundation
- **Target Project**: TradeAssist
- **Extension Type**: Code Refactoring/Optimization
- **Version**: 1.0

## Extension Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Decompose oversized service classes violating Single Responsibility Principle
- Eliminate code duplication through design pattern implementation
- Establish maintainable foundation for future development
- Reduce codebase complexity and technical debt

### Success Criteria
- HistoricalDataService reduced from 1400+ lines to 4 focused classes (<350 lines each)
- AnalyticsEngine._calculate_indicator god method replaced with Strategy Pattern
- Database session boilerplate reduced by 300+ lines through decorator implementation
- All service classes comply with 500-line maximum rule
- 1000+ total lines of code reduction achieved
- Test coverage maintained at 90%+ for refactored components

## Functional Requirements
### Core Features
- **HistoricalDataService Decomposition**: Split massive 1400-line class into:
  - `HistoricalDataFetcher`: Data retrieval from external APIs
  - `HistoricalDataCache`: Caching operations and cache management
  - `HistoricalDataQueryManager`: Query handling and parameter validation
  - `HistoricalDataValidator`: Data validation and integrity checks

- **Strategy Pattern for Technical Indicators**: Replace 98-line god method with:
  - `IndicatorCalculator`: Main coordinator class
  - Individual strategy classes: `RSIStrategy`, `MACDStrategy`, `BollingerStrategy`, etc.
  - `IndicatorStrategy` base interface for consistency

- **Database Session Decorators**: Eliminate repeated 15-line patterns with:
  - `@with_db_session`: Automatic session management
  - `@with_validated_instrument`: Instrument validation and injection
  - `@handle_db_errors`: Consistent error handling

### Implementation Patterns
- **Decorator Pattern**: For cross-cutting concerns (DB sessions, validation, error handling)
- **Strategy Pattern**: For algorithm variations (technical indicators)
- **Facade Pattern**: For simplified interfaces to complex subsystems
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each class has one reason to change

## Integration Requirements
### Existing System Integration
- **API Layer Integration**: All existing API endpoints must continue to work without changes
- **Service Layer Integration**: New decomposed services must maintain existing public interfaces
- **Database Integration**: No changes to database schema or queries
- **WebSocket Integration**: Real-time data flow must remain unaffected

### Data Requirements
- **Data Sources**: No changes to existing data sources
- **Data Storage**: Maintain existing database models and relationships
- **Data Flow**: Preserve existing data flow patterns while improving internal structure

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Compatibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing API contracts must be maintained
- **API Compatibility**: No breaking changes to public interfaces
- **Database Compatibility**: No schema changes required

### Performance
- **Response Time**: Maintain or improve current API response times
- **Memory Usage**: Reduce memory footprint through better object lifecycle management
- **Code Maintainability**: Achieve high cohesion and low coupling in refactored classes

## Constraints and Assumptions
### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing API contracts and response formats
- Cannot modify database schema during this extension
- Must preserve all existing functionality during refactoring
- All changes must be covered by comprehensive unit tests

### Business Constraints  
- Zero downtime deployment required
- Must not impact current user workflows
- Implementation must be completed within 2-3 week timeline
- No budget for external dependencies or major infrastructure changes

### Assumptions
- Existing test suite provides adequate coverage for regression testing
- Development team has expertise in design patterns and refactoring techniques
- Continuous integration pipeline can handle incremental deployments
- Code review process will catch any integration issues

## Out of Scope
- Database schema modifications (covered in Extension 2)
- Frontend integration changes (covered in Extension 3)
- New feature development (focus is on refactoring existing code)
- Performance optimizations beyond code structure improvements
- External API integrations or new data sources
