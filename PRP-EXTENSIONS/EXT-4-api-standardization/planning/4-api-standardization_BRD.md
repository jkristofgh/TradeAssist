# Extension Business Requirements Document

## Extension Overview
- **Extension Name**: API Standardization & Reliability
- **Target Project**: TradeAssist
- **Extension Type**: System Standardization/Quality Enhancement
- **Version**: 1.0

## Extension Objectives
### Primary Goals
- Establish consistent patterns and conventions across all API endpoints
- Implement standardized error handling and response formats
- Reduce API maintenance overhead through shared utilities
- Improve developer experience with predictable API behavior

### Success Criteria
- 100% consistent error response format across all API endpoints
- Standardized pagination implementation across all list endpoints
- 200+ lines of duplicated error handling code eliminated
- 150+ lines of response building code reduced through factory pattern
- API documentation automatically generated from standardized patterns
- Developer onboarding time reduced through consistent API conventions

## Functional Requirements
### Core Features
- **Standardized Error Response Format**:
  - Implement consistent `ErrorResponse` model across all endpoints
  - Include error code, message, details, and timestamp in all error responses
  - Replace inconsistent `detail` vs `message` field usage
  - Add structured error categorization (validation, authentication, system, etc.)

- **Response Builder Factory Pattern**:
  - Create `APIResponseBuilder` class for consistent response formatting
  - Implement specialized builders: `AnalyticsResponseBuilder`, `InstrumentResponseBuilder`
  - Standardize timestamp formatting (ISO 8601) across all responses
  - Include consistent metadata fields (pagination, caching, performance metrics)

- **Validation Decorator System**:
  - Implement `@validate_lookback_hours`, `@validate_confidence_level` decorators
  - Create parameter validation framework for common patterns
  - Add input sanitization and type coercion utilities
  - Generate standardized validation error responses

### API Consistency Improvements
- **Pagination Standardization**:
  - Implement consistent `PaginatedResponse` wrapper for all list endpoints
  - Add standard pagination parameters: `page`, `per_page`, `sort_by`, `sort_order`
  - Include pagination metadata: `total`, `pages`, `has_next`, `has_prev`
  - Optimize large dataset handling with cursor-based pagination option

- **Configuration Constants Extraction**:
  - Create centralized configuration classes for all hardcoded values
  - Implement `TechnicalIndicatorConfig`, `CacheConfig`, `APILimitsConfig`
  - Add environment-based configuration overrides
  - Document all configuration options with sensible defaults

## Integration Requirements
### Existing System Integration
- **Backward Compatibility**: All existing API contracts must remain functional
- **Gradual Migration**: Support both old and new response formats during transition
- **Monitoring Integration**: Error tracking and metrics collection for all standardized patterns
- **Documentation Integration**: Automated API documentation generation from standardized schemas

### Data Requirements
- **Response Consistency**: All API responses follow standardized format patterns
- **Error Tracking**: Comprehensive error classification and tracking system
- **Configuration Management**: Centralized configuration with proper validation
- **Performance Metrics**: Response time and error rate tracking for all standardized endpoints

## Non-Functional Requirements
### Developer Experience
- **API Predictability**: Developers can predict response format from any endpoint
- **Error Clarity**: Error messages provide actionable guidance for resolution
- **Documentation Quality**: Auto-generated documentation is complete and accurate
- **Testing Support**: Standardized patterns support automated testing frameworks

### Operational Excellence
- **Error Monitoring**: Structured error reporting enables better operational insights
- **Performance Tracking**: Standardized metrics collection across all endpoints
- **Configuration Management**: Safe and auditable configuration changes
- **Debugging Support**: Consistent error context enables faster issue resolution

## Constraints and Assumptions
### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain 100% backward compatibility during rollout
- Cannot introduce breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Standard patterns must work with existing authentication and authorization
- New patterns must integrate with existing logging and monitoring systems

### Business Constraints  
- Implementation must not impact existing user workflows
- Standardization effort should reduce long-term maintenance costs
- Must complete within 1-2 weeks as final polish before production
- Cannot require extensive retraining of development team

### Assumptions
- Development team committed to adopting new standardized patterns
- Existing API consumers can handle additional metadata in responses
- Monitoring systems can accommodate new structured error formats
- Documentation generation tools available and functional

## Out of Scope
- Major API redesign or version changes (focus is on consistency within current version)
- Database schema changes (covered in Extension 2)
- New feature development (focus is on improving existing API quality)
- Frontend-specific API optimizations (covered in Extension 3)
- External API integrations beyond existing patterns
