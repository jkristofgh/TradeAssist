### Existing Endpoints Modified
- `GET /api/health` - Enhanced with configuration validation and performance monitoring integration
- Enhanced OpenAPI documentation generation affects all existing endpoints with improved schema documentation

### API Usage Examples
```bash
# Validate system configuration
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/config/validate

# Get performance statistics for specific endpoint
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/performance/statistics?endpoint=/api/analytics/market-analysis"

# Reload configuration and detect changes
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/config/reload

# Check performance alert status
curl -X GET http://localhost:8000/api/performance/alerts
```

## Testing and Validation

## For Next Phase Integration
### Available APIs and Services
- **Performance Monitor Service**: `performance_monitor.track_request(endpoint, method)` - Context manager for tracking API performance in any service
- **Configuration Validation**: `/api/config/validate` endpoint - Operational teams can validate system configuration state
- **Optimized Response Builders**: `create_optimized_response_builder(response_type)` - Factory for high-performance response builders
- **Enhanced Documentation**: Auto-generated OpenAPI schemas with standardized error documentation for all endpoints

### Integration Examples
```python
# Using performance monitoring in any service
from src.backend.services.api_performance_monitor import track_api_performance

async def my_api_endpoint():
    async with track_api_performance("/api/my-endpoint", "GET") as metrics:
        # Your endpoint logic here
        result = await some_operation()
        
        # Optional: Mark cache hit/miss for metrics
        metrics['cache_hit'] = True
        return result

# Using optimized response builders
from src.backend.api.common.responses import create_optimized_response_builder

builder = create_optimized_response_builder("analytics")
return builder.success(data, metadata={"correlation_id": "12345"})

# Configuration validation integration
from src.backend.api.common.configuration import config_manager

# Access new monitoring configuration
monitoring_config = config_manager.monitoring
if monitoring_config.enable_performance_tracking:
    await track_performance_metrics()
```

### Extension Points Created
- **Performance Monitoring Framework**: Other extensions can register custom metrics and alerting rules
- **Configuration Validation System**: Extensions can add their own configuration validation rules
- **Response Builder Pattern**: Standardized approach for creating optimized API responses across all domains
- **OpenAPI Enhancement**: Automatic documentation generation for any new endpoints following established patterns

## Lessons Learned
### What Worked Well
- **Incremental Integration Approach**: Building on existing configuration system prevented breaking changes
- **Performance-First Design**: Context manager pattern for performance tracking provides clean integration
- **Template-Based Documentation**: Auto-generating OpenAPI schemas ensures consistency across endpoints
- **Caching Strategy**: Pre-computed response templates significantly reduce serialization overhead

### Challenges and Solutions
- **Import Circular Dependencies**: **Solution**: Moved shared imports to common modules and used lazy imports where needed
- **Pydantic V2 Migration**: **Solution**: Updated `.dict()` calls to `.model_dump()` and ensured compatibility across configuration system  
- **Performance Overhead**: **Solution**: Implemented sampling strategies and caching mechanisms to achieve <10ms target
- **Configuration Complexity**: **Solution**: Comprehensive `.env.example` documentation and validation endpoints for operational clarity

### Recommendations for Future Phases
- **Leverage Performance Framework**: Use established performance monitoring patterns for tracking new functionality
- **Extend Configuration System**: Add new configuration sections using the established MonitoringConfig pattern
- **Maintain Response Standards**: Use optimized response builders for consistency and performance
- **Build on Documentation Framework**: Leverage enhanced OpenAPI generation for new endpoints
