## 📋 Overview

### What is Complex Multi-Phase PRP?
The Complex Multi-Phase Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) framework is an extension of the standard PRP methodology designed for large, complex software projects that require multiple development phases. Unlike simple PRPs that handle individual features, this framework manages entire application development with full context continuity across phases.

### Key Benefits
- **Context Preservation**: Each phase understands exactly what was built previously
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in testing and validation at every stage
- **Scalability**: Handles projects of any complexity level
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation throughout development
- **Performance Tracking**: Continuous performance monitoring across phases

### 📂 CLAUDE File Management Strategy

#### Repository + Copy Approach
- **PLANNING/ Directory**: Serves as the authoritative repository for all CLAUDE development guidelines
- **Automatic Distribution**: `/execute-prp` command copies files to appropriate locations for Claude Code auto-discovery
- **Claude Code Integration**: Files are placed where Claude Code expects them for automatic reading
- **Version Control**: PLANNING/ maintains master versions; working copies are updated automatically

#### File Distribution During `/execute-prp`
```bash
# Automatic CLAUDE file setup during phase execution:
1. Copy PLANNING/CLAUDE_PROJECT.md → CLAUDE.md (project root - always)
2. Copy PLANNING/CLAUDE_BACKEND.md → backend/CLAUDE.md (if backend/ exists)
3. Copy PLANNING/CLAUDE_FRONTEND.md → frontend/CLAUDE.md (if frontend/ exists)  
4. Copy PLANNING/CLAUDE_SHARED.md → shared/CLAUDE.md (if shared/ exists)
5. Apply project-specific customizations during copy process
```

## 📋 BRD and Architecture Integration Methodology

### The Foundation Documents
Complex PRP methodology is designed to systematically transform business requirements and technical architecture into optimal development phases. The two foundational documents are:

#### Business Requirements Document (BRD)
```markdown
Purpose: Defines WHAT needs to be built and WHY
Key Sections for Phase Planning:
- Business objectives and success criteria
- User stories and functional requirements  
- Performance and quality requirements
- Integration and external system requirements
- Delivery scope and constraints
- Success metrics and acceptance criteria

Example BRD Elements for Phase Planning:
- "Sub-second alert processing" → Drives performance-focused Phase 1
- "Multi-channel notifications" → Drives integration-focused Phase 3
- "Real-time dashboard" → Drives UI-focused Phase 2
- "99% uptime requirement" → Drives reliability across all phases
```

#### Architecture Document
```markdown
Purpose: Defines HOW the system will be built technically
Key Sections for Phase Planning:
- System components and their relationships
- Technology stack and framework decisions
- Data flow and integration patterns
- Performance architecture and optimization
- Security architecture and patterns
- Deployment and operational architecture

Example Architecture Elements for Phase Planning:
- "Ultra-light single process" → Suggests smaller, sequential phases
- "Event-driven microservices" → Suggests larger, parallel phases
- "Real-time WebSocket system" → Drives foundational Phase 1 requirement
- "React frontend with complex state" → Drives dedicated UI Phase 2
```

### Systematic Analysis Process

#### BRD Analysis for Phase Planning
```bash
# The /plan-project-phases command performs this analysis automatically

Business Complexity Assessment:
- Count functional requirements → Phase scope sizing
- Identify performance requirements → Performance-critical phases
- Map user workflows → UI complexity phases
- Identify integrations → Integration-focused phases
- Assess compliance needs → Security/validation phases

Requirements Dependency Mapping:
- Core business logic → Foundation phase requirements
- User interface needs → UI phase requirements  
- External integrations → Integration phase requirements
- Performance optimizations → Optimization phase requirements
```

#### Architecture Analysis for Phase Planning
```bash
# Technical complexity drives phase structure and sequencing

Component Complexity Assessment:
- Database and data models → Foundation phase scope
- API and service layers → Backend phase requirements
- Frontend and user experience → UI phase scope
- External system integrations → Integration phase scope
- Performance and monitoring → Optimization phase needs

Dependency Analysis:
- Which components must exist before others can be built
- How components integrate and share data
- What performance characteristics cascade through system
- Which security requirements affect multiple components
```

### Integration-Driven Phase Design

#### Requirements-to-Phase Mapping
```markdown
Example: TradeAssist Trading Platform

FROM BRD REQUIREMENTS:
- "Connect to Schwab API for real-time data" → Phase 1: Data Foundation
- "Sub-second alert processing" → Phase 1: Performance-critical core
- "Real-time dashboard display" → Phase 2: UI consuming Phase 1 APIs
- "Multi-channel notifications (sound, Slack)" → Phase 3: Integration layer
- "99% uptime in production" → Phase 4: Production optimization

FROM ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS:
- "Ultra-light single process (FastAPI + SQLite)" → Sequential phases preferred
- "WebSocket real-time updates" → Phase 1 must establish WebSocket foundation
- "React frontend with complex state" → Dedicated Phase 2 for frontend complexity
- "Google Cloud Secret Manager" → Phase 3 security integration requirements
```

#### Dependency-Driven Sequencing
```markdown
TECHNICAL DEPENDENCY ANALYSIS:
Phase 1 (Foundation): No dependencies - establishes base system
├── Database schema for market data
├── Core business logic for alert processing
├── Basic API structure
└── WebSocket foundation for real-time updates

Phase 2 (Frontend): Depends on Phase 1 APIs and WebSocket
├── Real-time dashboard consuming Phase 1 WebSocket
├── Alert management UI using Phase 1 REST APIs  
├── User workflow patterns
└── Frontend state management for real-time data

Phase 3 (Integration): Depends on Phase 1 + 2 working system
├── Slack integration using established alert patterns
├── Sound notifications triggered by Phase 1 alerts
├── Security integration with Google Cloud
└── End-to-end testing of complete workflows

Phase 4 (Production): Depends on Phase 1-3 complete system
├── Performance optimization based on real usage patterns
├── Production monitoring and alerting
├── Security hardening for production deployment
└── Documentation and operational procedures
```

### Advanced Integration Strategies

#### Performance-Driven Planning
```markdown
When BRD has strict performance requirements (like sub-second processing):

Phase 1 Focus: Establish performance foundation
- Core algorithms optimized for performance targets
- Database schema optimized for query performance
- Caching and optimization strategies implemented
- Performance monitoring and baseline establishment

Subsequent Phases: Maintain performance baselines
- Each phase validates performance doesn't degrade
- Performance testing integrated into each phase
- Optimization opportunities identified and implemented
- Performance characteristics documented for next phases
```

#### Integration-Heavy Planning  
```markdown
When Architecture has many external system integrations:

Foundation Phase: Core system without integrations
- Establish stable core functionality
- Create integration abstractions and interfaces
- Implement circuit breaker and error handling patterns
- Build foundation for external system connectivity

Integration Phases: Systematic external system addition
- One integration focus per phase (avoid integration complexity compounding)
- Full testing and validation of each integration
- Error handling and fallback strategies for each integration
- Integration patterns established for consistency
```

#### User Experience-Driven Planning
```markdown
When BRD emphasizes user experience and complex workflows:

Backend Foundation: Stable APIs for UI consumption
- APIs designed specifically for frontend needs
- Real-time data delivery mechanisms established  
- Data formats optimized for frontend consumption
- Performance targets set for user experience requirements

UI-Focused Phases: Dedicated frontend development phases
- Complex state management and user workflows
- Responsive design and user experience optimization
- Accessibility and usability validation
- User testing and feedback integration
```

### Quality Integration Methodology

#### BRD Quality Requirements Integration
```markdown
Quality Requirements from BRD → Phase Integration Strategy:

"99% uptime requirement":
- Phase 1: Error handling and graceful degradation
- Phase 2: Frontend error boundaries and user feedback
- Phase 3: Integration reliability and fallback strategies  
- Phase 4: Production monitoring and alerting

"Sub-second response time":
- Phase 1: Core performance optimization and baseline

- Phase 2: Frontend security and session management  
- Phase 3: Integration security and external system protection
- Phase 4: Production security hardening and audit compliance
```

#### Architecture Quality Attributes Integration
```markdown
Architecture Quality Decisions → Phase Implementation:

"Event-driven architecture for scalability":
- Phase 1: Event system foundation and core event patterns
- Phase 2: Frontend event consumption and reactive UI
- Phase 3: Integration event patterns and external system events
- Phase 4: Event monitoring, debugging, and production operations

"Microservices for maintainability":
- Phase 1: Service boundaries and inter-service communication
- Phase 2: Service discovery and load balancing  
- Phase 3: Service integration patterns and testing
- Phase 4: Service monitoring, debugging, and operations

"Single process for simplicity":
- Phase 1: Modular architecture within single process
- Phase 2: Internal communication patterns and state management
- Phase 3: External integration within process boundaries
- Phase 4: Single-process optimization and monitoring
```

## 📊 Phase Planning Strategy

### Systematic vs. Ad Hoc Phase Planning

#### ⚡ **RECOMMENDED: Systematic Planning (New)**
Use `/plan-project-phases` command for data-driven, optimal phase breakdown:

```bash
# Systematic approach - analyzes BRD and Architecture documents
/plan-project-phases PLANNING/BRD_ProjectName.md PLANNING/Architecture_ProjectName.md

# Automatically creates:
# - PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md (master plan)
# - PHASE1_REQUIREMENTS.md, PHASE2_REQUIREMENTS.md, etc. (all phases)
# - PHASE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md (visual dependencies)
# - Optimal sequencing based on dependency analysis
```

**Benefits:**
- **Data-driven decisions**: Based on actual BRD requirements and architecture complexity
- **Optimal dependencies**: Systematic dependency mapping prevents integration issues
- **Complete coverage**: All requirements automatically mapped to appropriate phases
- **Time savings**: All phase requirements files created with proper cross-references

#### 📝 **ALTERNATIVE: Manual Planning (Original)**
For simple projects or when systematic planning needs customization:

### 1. Project Analysis and Decomposition
**Step 1: Analyze Your Project**
- Review BRD and architecture documents
- Identify major components and their dependencies
- Map out integration points between components
- Determine performance and quality requirements

**Step 2: Component Dependency Mapping**
```
Example for TradeAssist:
Phase 1 (Foundation): Data ingestion + Alert engine
    ↓ (APIs and database schema)
Phase 2 (Frontend): React dashboard + WebSocket client
    ↓ (UI patterns and user workflows)
Phase 3 (Integration): Notifications + Security
    ↓ (Complete system)
Phase 4 (Optimization): Performance tuning + Production deployment
```


### 2. Phase Sequencing Strategy

#### Sequential Approach (Recommended)
- **Advantages**: Clear dependencies, easier testing
- **Best for**: Complex integrations, performance-critical systems
- **Example**: Foundation → Frontend → Integration → Production

#### Parallel Approach (Advanced)
- **Advantages**: Faster development, parallel team work
- **Challenges**: Complex integration, requires experienced teams
- **Best for**: Independent components, experienced teams

#### Hybrid Approach
- **Core phases sequential**: Foundation and critical paths
- **Independent features parallel**: UI components, utilities
- **Best for**: Large projects with mixed dependencies

### 3. Phase Sizing Guidelines

#### Small Phases
- **Pros**: Quick feedback, easier debugging
- **Cons**: More phase overhead, more integration points
- **Best for**: New technologies

#### Medium Phases
- **Pros**: Good balance of scope and manageability
- **Cons**: Moderate integration complexity
- **Best for**: Most projects, balanced teams

#### Large Phases
- **Pros**: Fewer integration points, larger feature sets
- **Cons**: Delayed feedback
- **Best for**: Well-understood technologies, experienced teams

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Implementation

### 🎯 **NEW RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW: Systematic Planning**

#### Step 0: Systematic Project Planning
```bash
# FIRST: Generate optimal phase plan from your project documents
/plan-project-phases PLANNING/BRD_YourProject.md PLANNING/Architecture_YourProject.md

# This creates:
# - PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md (replaces manual PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md)
# - All PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md files with proper dependencies
# - PHASE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md with visual dependency mapping
# - Optimal phase sequencing based on complexity analysis
```

### Phase 1: Execute First Phase (Streamlined)

#### Step 1.1: ✅ Skip - Already Created
Project overview and phase files already generated by systematic planning.

#### Step 1.2: ✅ Skip - Already Created  
PHASE1_REQUIREMENTS.md already generated with optimal scope and dependencies.

#### Step 1.3: Generate and Execute Phase 1 PRP
```bash
# Generate comprehensive PRP (takes 10-15 minutes)
/generate-prp PHASE1_REQUIREMENTS.md

# Review and validate the generated PRP
# Make any necessary adjustments

# Execute the PRP
/execute-prp PRPs/[generated-phase1-prp].md
```

#### Step 1.4: Create Phase 1 Completion Summary
```bash
# Use the automated command to generate comprehensive completion summary
/update-phase-completion 1

# This will:
- Analyze the current codebase automatically
- Extract actual implementation details from code
- Document API endpoints with real request/response formats
- Capture database schema as implemented
- Measure and record actual performance metrics
- Identify integration points ready for Phase 2
- Create PRPs/PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md with all details
```

#### Step 1.5: 🆕 Adapt Future Phase Plans
```bash
# NEW: Update remaining phases based on actual Phase 1 implementation
/update-phase-plans 1

# This will:
- Analyze PHASE1_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md for actual vs planned implementation
- Update PHASE2_REQUIREMENTS.md, PHASE3_REQUIREMENTS.md, etc. with real integration context
- Adjust scope and dependencies based on actual development experience
- Update performance baselines with real measurements
- Create PHASE_ADAPTATION_LOG.md tracking all changes made
```

### Phase N: Subsequent Phases (Streamlined)

#### Step N.1: ✅ Skip - Already Updated
PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md files already updated by `/update-phase-plans` with:
- Real integration context from previous phase completion summaries
- Actual API endpoints and usage examples
- Real database schema evolution patterns
- Measured performance baselines to maintain

#### Step N.2: Validate Pre-Phase Integration
```bash
# Run pre-phase validation (see INTEGRATION_VALIDATION_FRAMEWORK.md)
- Check previous phase stability
- Validate API contracts
- Confirm performance baselines
- Verify documentation completeness
```

#### Step N.3: Generate and Execute Phase N PRP
```bash
/generate-prp PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md
# Review with special attention to integration points
/execute-prp PRPs/[generated-phase-prp].md
```

#### Step N.4: Integration Validation
```bash
# Run comprehensive integration tests
- End-to-end workflow testing
- Cross-phase compatibility validation
- Performance regression testing
- Security and error handling validation
```

#### Step N.5: Create Phase N Completion Summary
```bash
# Use the automated command for any phase number
/update-phase-completion [N]

# For example:
/update-phase-completion 2  # Creates PHASE2_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md
/update-phase-completion 3  # Creates PHASE3_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md

# This will:
- Analyze codebase changes since previous phase
- Extract all implemented components and their purposes
- Document new API endpoints and integration points
- Compare performance against previous phase baselines
- Prepare comprehensive context for next phase development
```

#### Step N.6: 🆕 Adapt Remaining Phase Plans
```bash
# NEW: Update remaining phases based on actual Phase N implementation
/update-phase-plans [N]

# For example:
/update-phase-plans 2  # Adapts Phase 3, 4, etc. based on Phase 2 reality
/update-phase-plans 3  # Adapts Phase 4, 5, etc. based on Phase 3 reality

# This will:
- Analyze actual vs planned implementation from Phase N
- Update remaining INITIAL_PHASE files with real integration context
- Adjust scope and scope based on development velocity
- Update PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md with lessons learned
```

## 🔗 Context Continuity Management

### Critical Success Factor: Context Continuity
The most important aspect of complex PRP is ensuring each phase has complete understanding of previous work. Here's how to ensure this:

### 1. Completion Summary Best Practices

#### What to Document in Detail:
```markdown
## Implemented Components (Be Specific)
- File paths and their purposes

- Extension points: Where new functionality can plug in
- Performance patterns: Established patterns to follow
```

### 2. Phase Requirements Best Practices

#### Previous Phase Context Section:
```markdown
## Previous Phase Context
### What Already Exists (Copy from completion summaries)
- Specific file references: backend/services/alert_engine.py
- API endpoints: GET /api/alerts, POST /api/rules
- Database tables: market_data, alert_rules, alert_logs
- Performance baselines: <500ms alert processing achieved

### Integration Points Available
- AlertEngine.process_tick() method available
- WebSocket broadcast via ConnectionManager.broadcast()
- Database models: MarketTick, AlertRule, AlertLog
```

#### Integration Requirements Section:
```markdown
## Integration Requirements

- **Integration Context**: Includes previous phase APIs and performance baselines
- **Forward Compatibility**: Prepares interfaces for next phase consumption

#### Template Selection Strategy:
```yaml
# In PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md - Template Configuration Section
## 📋 Template Configuration Strategy

### Template Assignment Logic
template_assignments:
  default_template: prp_base.md  # Enhanced version handles all complexity levels
  
  # Phase-specific template configuration
  phase_1:
    template: prp_base.md
    project_type: complex_multi_phase
    phase_type: foundation
    complexity_level: high
    
  phase_2:
    template: prp_base.md
    project_type: complex_multi_phase
    phase_type: integration
    complexity_level: medium
    
  phase_N:
    template: prp_base.md
    project_type: complex_multi_phase
    phase_type: optimization
    complexity_level: high

# Example Phase Overview with Template Assignments
Phase 1: Core Foundation - Type: Foundation - Template: prp_base.md
├── Phase Type: foundation
├── Complexity: high
└── Auto-activates: External API integration, database design, performance baselines

Phase 2: Frontend Integration - Type: Integration - Template: prp_base.md  
├── Phase Type: integration
├── Complexity: medium
└── Auto-activates: Previous phase consumption, cross-component testing, UI patterns

Phase 3: System Optimization - Type: Optimization - Template: prp_base.md
├── Phase Type: optimization
├── Complexity: high
└── Auto-activates: System-wide testing, production readiness, end-to-end validation
```

#### How Template Assignment Works:
1. **Planning Phase**: `/plan-project-phases` creates PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md with template assignments
2. **Generation Phase**: `/generate-prp PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md` automatically reads template assignment
3. **Context Population**: Template is populated with phase-specific context (previous phase APIs, performance baselines)
4. **Validation Selection**: Appropriate validation levels are activated based on phase type and complexity

#### Benefits:
- **One Template**: Single enhanced template handles all scenarios
- **Automatic Adaptation**: Template sections activate based on project complexity
- **Backward Compatible**: Existing workflows continue to work
- **Context Rich**: Includes integration context from previous phases

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites Checklist
Before starting your Complex PRP project, ensure you have:
- [ ] **Business Requirements Document (BRD)**: Clear requirements and success criteria
- [ ] **Architecture Document**: Technical approach and system design
- [ ] **Claude Code**: With all PRP commands installed and working
- [ ] **Development Environment**: Set up and ready for your technology stack
- [ ] **Project Repository**: Version control initialized

### 🎯 Recommended Workflow (Systematic Planning)

#### Step 1: Systematic Phase Planning (5-10 minutes)
```bash
# Generate optimal phase plan from your project documents
/plan-project-phases path/to/your/BRD.md path/to/your/Architecture.md

# This automatically creates:
# ✅ PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md - Master phase plan with dependencies
# ✅ PHASE_DEPENDENCY_MAP.md - Visual dependency analysis  
# ✅ PHASE1_REQUIREMENTS.md, PHASE2_REQUIREMENTS.md, etc. - All phase files
# ✅ Optimal sequencing based on requirements and architecture analysis
```

#### Step 2: Execute Each Phase (Iterative)
```bash
# For each phase (1, 2, 3, ...):

# 2a. Generate comprehensive PRP (automatically uses template from PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md)
/generate-prp PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md

# 2b. Execute the implementation (now with phase-aware validation)
/execute-prp PRPs/[generated-prp-file].md

# 2c. Document completion automatically
/update-phase-completion [N]

# 2d. Adapt future phases based on learnings
/update-phase-plans [N]

# Repeat for next phase...
```

**NEW**: The generate-prp command now automatically:
- Reads template assignment from PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md
- Uses enhanced prp_base.md with phase-aware capabilities
- Includes previous phase integration context for phases >1
- Applies appropriate validation levels based on project complexity

#### Step 3: Project Completion
Your systematic approach ensures:
- ✅ All BRD requirements fulfilled
- ✅ Architecture properly implemented  
- ✅ Performance targets achieved
- ✅ Integration tested and validated
- ✅ Complete documentation for maintenance

### 📝 Alternative Manual Workflow
If systematic planning doesn't fit your needs:
1. **Manual Phase Planning**: Use strategies in [Phase Planning Strategy](#phase-planning-strategy)
2. **Create Phase Requirementss**: Manually copy and customize templates
3. **Execute Phases**: Same execution steps as above
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Extra attention needed for context continuity

### 🔧 Quick Troubleshooting
**Command not found**: Ensure Claude Code is updated with latest PRP commands  
**Template not found errors**: Verify all templates are in PRPs/templates/ directory with correct names  
**BRD/Architecture analysis fails**: Check document format, file paths, and content completeness  
**Phase plan seems wrong**: Review and customize generated phase requirements files before execution  
**Integration issues**: Use `/update-phase-plans` to adapt based on actual implementation  
**Performance tracking inconsistent**: Use standardized performance reporting format in completion summaries  
**Template assignment not working**: Check PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md has template_assignments section with proper YAML format  
**Validation levels not activating**: Verify phase_type and complexity_level are set in PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md  
**Previous phase integration missing**: Ensure PHASE*_COMPLETION_SUMMARY.md files exist for integration context  

### 🎯 Success Tips
- **Trust the systematic planning**: It analyzes dependencies better than manual planning
- **Validate generated plans**: Review and adjust phase requirements files if needed
- **Document reality**: Use `/update-phase-completion` after each phase
