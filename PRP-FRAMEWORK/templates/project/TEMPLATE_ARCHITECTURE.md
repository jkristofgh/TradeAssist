## Complex PRP Framework Integration

### For Complex Multi-Phase Projects

This architecture document serves as input to the Complex Multi-Phase PRP framework's systematic phase planning process when combined with the corresponding BRD.

#### Framework Usage
```bash
# After completing this Architecture document and the BRD:
/plan-project-phases PLANNING/BRD_[ProjectName].md PLANNING/Architecture_[ProjectName].md
```

This command analyzes the architecture complexity and business requirements to:
- Generate optimal phase breakdown based on component dependencies
- Create properly sequenced PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md files
- Establish technical integration points and performance baselines
- Generate technical implementation roadmap across phases

#### Architecture Elements for Phase Planning
Ensure this document includes:
- **Component Dependencies**: Clear dependency mapping for phase sequencing
- **Performance Requirements**: Specific and measurable targets for baseline establishment
- **Integration Points**: Detailed interface definitions for phase boundary planning
- **Technology Rationale**: Decision justification for template population and complexity assessment

#### CLAUDE File Management
During the `/execute-prp` command, CLAUDE development guidelines are automatically distributed:
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_PROJECT.md` → `CLAUDE.md` (project root) - Always copied
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_BACKEND.md` → `backend/CLAUDE.md` - If backend/ directory exists
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_FRONTEND.md` → `frontend/CLAUDE.md` - If frontend/ directory exists  
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_SHARED.md` → `shared/CLAUDE.md` - If shared/ directory exists

This ensures proper Claude Code auto-discovery while maintaining centralized documentation in PLANNING/.
