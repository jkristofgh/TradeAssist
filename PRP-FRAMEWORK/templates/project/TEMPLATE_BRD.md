## Complex PRP Framework Integration

### For Complex Multi-Phase Projects

If this project qualifies for the Complex Multi-Phase PRP framework (multiple components, complex architecture, performance requirements, integration points, regulatory requirements, or scalability needs), this BRD will be used as input to the systematic phase planning process.

#### Framework Usage
```bash
# After completing this BRD and the Architecture document:
/plan-project-phases PLANNING/BRD_[ProjectName].md PLANNING/Architecture_[ProjectName].md
```

This command will analyze the business requirements and technical architecture to:
- Generate optimal phase breakdown based on dependency analysis
- Create all PHASE[N]_REQUIREMENTS.md files with proper sequencing
- Establish integration points and performance baselines across phases
- Generate PROJECT_PHASE_PLAN.md master planning document

#### CLAUDE File Management
During the `/execute-prp` command, CLAUDE development guidelines will be automatically copied from the PLANNING/ repository to the appropriate project locations:
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_PROJECT.md` â†’ `CLAUDE.md` (project root)
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_BACKEND.md` â†’ `backend/CLAUDE.md` (if backend/ exists)
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_FRONTEND.md` â†’ `frontend/CLAUDE.md` (if frontend/ exists)
- `PLANNING/CLAUDE_SHARED.md` â†’ `shared/CLAUDE.md` (if shared/ exists)

This ensures Claude Code auto-discovery works correctly while maintaining authoritative versions in PLANNING/.
