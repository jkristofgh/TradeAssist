## 🎯 Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path
```
[The longest path through the project - determines development sequence]

Critical Path: Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Phase 4
Sequence: [Phase 1 scope] → [Phase 2 scope] → [Phase 3 scope] → [Phase 4 scope]

Critical Components:
Phase 1: [Most time-consuming component]
  ↓ [Specific dependency]
Phase 2: [Component that depends on Phase 1 critical component]
  ↓ [Specific dependency]  
Phase 3: [Component that depends on Phase 2 output]
  ↓ [Specific dependency]
Phase 4: [Final integration depending on all previous phases]
```

### Alternative Paths
```
[Shorter paths that could be optimized for faster delivery]

Alternative Path 1 (Parallel Development):
Phase 1A: [Independent components] - [Duration]
Phase 1B: [Other independent components] - [Duration]
  ↓ [Both required for Phase 2]
Phase 2: [Combined integration] - [Duration]

Alternative Path 2 (MVP Fast Track):
Phase 1: [Core MVP features only] - [Reduced duration]
  ↓ [Essential dependencies only]
Phase 2: [Essential UI only] - [Reduced duration]
  ↓ [Basic integration]
Phase 3: [MVP completion] - [Reduced duration]
```
