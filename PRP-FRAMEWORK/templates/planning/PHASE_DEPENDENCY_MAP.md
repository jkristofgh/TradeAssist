# TEMPLATE: Phase Dependency Map

## ðŸ“Š Visual Dependency Overview

### Project: [Project Name]
### Generated: [Date]
### Phases: [Total Number] phases planned

## ðŸ”— Dependency Graph

### Linear View (Sequential Dependencies)
```
Phase 1: [Phase Name]
    â†“ [API Contracts + Database Schema]
Phase 2: [Phase Name]  
    â†“ [UI Patterns + User Workflows]
Phase 3: [Phase Name]
    â†“ [Integration Patterns + Complete System]
Phase 4: [Phase Name]
```

### Dependency Matrix
```
        Phase 1  Phase 2  Phase 3  Phase 4
Phase 1    -      Yes      Yes      Yes
Phase 2    -       -       Yes      Yes  
Phase 3    -       -        -       Yes
Phase 4    -       -        -        -

Legend: Yes = Phase X depends on Phase Y, "-" = No dependency
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Critical Path Analysis

### Primary Critical Path
```
Critical Path: Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 â†’ Phase 4
Sequence: [Phase 1 scope] â†’ [Phase 2 scope] â†’ [Phase 3 scope] â†’ [Phase 4 scope]

Critical Components:
Phase 1: [Most time-consuming component]
  â†“ [Specific dependency]
Phase 2: [Component that depends on Phase 1 critical component]
  â†“ [Specific dependency]  
Phase 3: [Component that depends on Phase 2 output]
  â†“ [Specific dependency]
Phase 4: [Final integration depending on all previous phases]
```

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points Detail

### Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 Integration
```
Integration Type: API + Database
Dependency Strength: STRONG (Phase 2 cannot proceed without Phase 1)

Required from Phase 1:
- API Endpoints: [Specific endpoints with signatures]
- Database Schema: [Specific tables and relationships]  
- Authentication: [Auth system and token management]
- Performance Baseline: [Response time targets established]

Provided to Phase 2:
- [Specific interface contracts]
- [Data access patterns]
- [Error handling conventions]
- [Performance characteristics]

Integration Testing Required:
- API contract validation
- Data flow verification
- Performance baseline confirmation
- Error handling validation
```

### Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 Integration
```
Integration Type: UI Patterns + User Workflows
Dependency Strength: MEDIUM (Phase 3 can start with Phase 2 partial)

Required from Phase 2:
- UI Component Library: [Reusable components and patterns]
- User Workflows: [Established user interaction patterns]
- State Management: [Frontend state patterns and conventions]
- Design System: [Visual and interaction design standards]

Provided to Phase 3:
- [Frontend framework and conventions]
- [User experience patterns]
- [Component integration patterns]
- [Performance optimization patterns]

Integration Testing Required:
- UI component compatibility
- User workflow validation
- State management consistency
- Design system compliance
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Development Optimization

### Parallel Development Opportunities
```
Parallel Opportunity 1:
Components: [Component A] and [Component B]
Phases: Phase 1 and Phase 1 (parallel)
Dependencies: Both depend on [common foundation] but not on each other
Benefit: [Time savings]
Challenge: [Integration complexity when combining]

Parallel Opportunity 2:
Components: [Component C] and [Component D]  
Phases: Phase 2 and Phase 3 (overlap)
Dependencies: Component D can start before Phase 2 complete
Benefit: [Timeline compression]
Challenge: [Rework if Phase 2 changes Component C]
```

### MVP Fast Track Option
```
MVP Phase 1: [Core functionality only] - [Reduced timeline]
MVP Phase 2: [Essential UI only] - [Reduced timeline]
MVP Phase 3: [Basic integration] - [Reduced timeline]
Total MVP Timeline: [Compressed timeline vs full project]

Deferred to Post-MVP:
- [Advanced features moved to later]
- [Optimization phases moved to later]
- [Nice-to-have integrations moved to later]
```

### Dependency Reduction Opportunities
```
Current Dependency: Phase 3 â†’ Phase 2 (Complete UI)
Proposed: Phase 3 â†’ Phase 2 (Basic UI only)
Benefit: Phase 3 can start earlier
Implementation: [Specific changes needed]
```

## ðŸ”§ Management Notes

### Dependency Tracking
- **Update Frequency**: After each phase completion
- **Validation Method**: Integration testing at phase boundaries
- **Change Process**: Impact assessment â†’ stakeholder approval â†’ documentation update

### Integration Validation
- **API Contracts**: Automated contract testing
- **UI Patterns**: Component compatibility testing  
- **Data Flow**: End-to-end integration testing
- **Performance**: Baseline validation testing
