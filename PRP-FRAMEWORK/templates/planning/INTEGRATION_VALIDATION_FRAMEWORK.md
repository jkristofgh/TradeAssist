# Expected Response: [Document expected response format]

curl -X POST [endpoint_url] -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[sample_payload]'
# Expected Response: [Document expected response format]

# Test error scenarios
curl -X POST [endpoint_url] -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '[invalid_payload]'
# Expected Response: [Document expected error response]
```

### Database Integration Tests
```sql
-- Test database queries that will be used in current phase
SELECT * FROM [table_name] WHERE [conditions];
-- Expected Result: [Document expected data structure and performance]

-- Test database write operations
INSERT INTO [table_name] ([columns]) VALUES ([test_values]);
-- Expected Result: [Document expected behavior and constraints]

EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT * FROM [table_name] WHERE [conditions];
-- Expected Result: [Document expected query plan and index usage]
```

### WebSocket Integration Tests
```javascript
// Test WebSocket connections and message handling
const ws = new WebSocket('[websocket_url]');

ws.onopen = function() {
    console.log('WebSocket connection established');
    // Send test message
    ws.send(JSON.stringify([test_message]));
};

ws.onmessage = function(event) {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    console.log('Received:', data);
    // Validate message format matches documentation
};
```

### System Integration Tests
```bash
# Test complete workflows end-to-end
# [Document specific workflow being tested]

# Test error handling and recovery
# [Document error scenarios and expected recovery behavior]

# Test performance under load
# [Document load testing procedures and success criteria]
```

## üìä Performance Validation

### Performance Baseline Validation
```markdown
Verify that current phase maintains performance baselines from previous phases:

Performance Metrics to Maintain:
- Response Time: Current [X]ms <= Baseline [Y]ms
- Throughput: Current [X] req/sec >= Baseline [Y] req/sec  
- Memory Usage: Current [X]MB <= Baseline [Y]MB + [acceptable growth]%
- Database Performance: Current [X]ms <= Baseline [Y]ms
```

### Load Testing Procedures
```bash
# Define load testing scenarios
Scenario 1: Normal Load
- Concurrent Users: [number]
- Request Rate: [requests/second]
- Duration: [time period]
- Success Criteria: [response time, error rate thresholds]

Scenario 2: Peak Load
- Concurrent Users: [number]
- Request Rate: [requests/second]
- Duration: [time period]
- Success Criteria: [response time, error rate thresholds]

Scenario 3: Stress Test
- Concurrent Users: [number]
- Request Rate: [requests/second]
- Duration: [time period]
- Success Criteria: [graceful degradation, recovery behavior]
```

### Performance Monitoring Setup
```markdown
Ensure monitoring is in place for key performance indicators:

Monitoring Configuration:
- [ ] Response time monitoring for all API endpoints
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring with alerts
- [ ] Database query performance monitoring
- [ ] Error rate monitoring with thresholds
- [ ] WebSocket connection monitoring (if applicable)
```

## üîí Security Validation

### Security Integration Tests
```bash
# Test authentication and authorization
# [Document specific security tests]

# Test input validation and sanitization
# [Document input validation scenarios]

# Test error handling doesn't expose sensitive information
# [Document security error handling tests]
```

### Security Configuration Validation
```markdown
Verify security configurations are properly set:

Security Checklist:
- [ ] Authentication mechanisms are properly configured
- [ ] Authorization rules are correctly implemented
- [ ] Sensitive data is properly encrypted or protected
- [ ] Error messages don't expose internal system details
- [ ] Security headers are properly set
- [ ] Input validation is comprehensive and secure
```
