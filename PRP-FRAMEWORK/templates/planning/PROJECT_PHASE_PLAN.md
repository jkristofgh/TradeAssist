## ðŸ“‹ Template Configuration Strategy

### Template Assignment Logic
```yaml
template_assignments:
  default_template: prp_base.md  # Enhanced version handles all complexity levels
  
  # Phase-specific template configuration
  phase_1:
    template: prp_base.md
    project_type: complex_multi_phase
    phase_type: foundation
    complexity_level: [low | medium | high]
    
  phase_2:
    template: prp_base.md
    project_type: complex_multi_phase
    phase_type: [integration | frontend | optimization]
    complexity_level: [low | medium | high]
    
  phase_N:
    template: prp_base.md
    project_type: complex_multi_phase
    phase_type: [optimization | finalization]
    complexity_level: [low | medium | high]

# Template selection rationale
template_rationale:
  enhanced_prp_base: |
    The enhanced prp_base.md template adapts automatically to project complexity:
    - Simple features: Uses basic validation and simple patterns
    - Complex phases: Activates multi-level validation, performance testing, integration validation
    - Phase awareness: Includes previous phase context and forward compatibility preparation
    - Scales from single components to entire system phases
```

## ðŸ”— Dependency Analysis

- Phase 2: [Components that depend on Phase 1 and are needed by later phases]
- Phase N: [Final integration and optimization phases]
```

### Integration Points Map
```markdown
[Key integration points between phases]
Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2 Integration:
- API Endpoints: [Specific APIs that Phase 2 will consume]
- Database Schema: [Tables and data structures available]
- Event System: [Events that Phase 2 can subscribe to]
- Performance Baseline: [Performance characteristics to maintain]

Phase 2 â†’ Phase 3 Integration:
- UI Components: [Frontend patterns and components available]
