# Phase 1: Foundation Data & Alert Engine

## üìã Phase Information
- **Phase Number**: 1
- **Phase Name**: Foundation Data & Alert Engine
- **Dependencies**: None (Foundation phase)
- **Estimated Effort**: 5-6 weeks
- **Phase Type**: foundation
- **Complexity Level**: high

## üîÑ Previous Phase Context
### What Already Exists
```
This is the foundation phase - no previous implementation exists.
Starting from clean slate with:
- Project structure to be created
- Virtual environment setup required
- Initial FastAPI application framework
- SQLite database initialization
- Basic testing framework establishment
```

### Existing Codebase References
- **Backend Files**: `backend/` (to be created)
- **Database**: `data/trade_assist.db` (to be created)
- **Configuration**: `config/` (to be created)
- **Tests**: `tests/` (to be created)

### API Contracts Established
```
No existing API contracts - Phase 1 will establish the foundation APIs:
- RESTful endpoints for data access
- WebSocket connections for real-time streaming
- Authentication patterns for Schwab API integration
- Error handling and status reporting conventions
```

### Integration Points Available
```
No existing integration points - Phase 1 will create:
- Database connection patterns and ORM setup
- External API integration framework (Schwab API)
- WebSocket server infrastructure
- Async task processing foundations
```

## üéØ Current Phase Requirements

### Primary Objectives
```
1. Establish real-time data ingestion from Schwab API with sub-second latency
2. Implement core alert engine with rule evaluation under 500ms
3. Create SQLite database with optimized time-series schema
4. Build FastAPI service with WebSocket real-time streaming
5. Ensure 99% API connection reliability with automatic reconnection
```

### Detailed Requirements

#### Real-Time Data Integration
```
- Schwab API Integration: OAuth 2.0 authentication with automatic token refresh
  * Real-time streaming connection for futures: ES, NQ, YM, CL, GC
  * Real-time streaming for indices: SPX, NDX, RUT 
  * Real-time streaming for internals: VIX, TICK, ADD, TRIN
  * Historical data backfill capabilities
  * Rate limiting compliance and circuit breaker implementation

- Data Normalization: Unified data format across all instrument types
  * Sub-second timestamp precision
  * Consistent field mapping (price, volume, timestamp)
  * Data validation and error handling
  * Missing data detection and handling
```

#### Alert Engine Implementation
```
- Rule Evaluation Engine: Sub-second alert processing
  * Static threshold rules (price above/below threshold)
  * Crossover detection (price crossing moving average)
  * Rate-of-change calculations (% change over time period)
  * Volume spike detection
  * Multi-condition rule combinations (AND/OR logic)

- Alert Generation: Real-time alert firing and logging
  * Alert context capture (rule, timestamp, instrument, trigger value)
  * Duplicate suppression within configurable time windows
  * Alert severity levels and priority handling
  * Alert delivery status tracking
```

#### Database Architecture
```
- SQLite with WAL Mode: Optimized for time-series and application data
  * instruments table: symbol, name, type, status, last_tick, created_at
  * market_data table: timestamp, instrument_id, price, volume, bid, ask
  * alert_rules table: id, instrument_id, rule_type, threshold, condition, active, created_at
  * alert_logs table: timestamp, rule_id, instrument_id, trigger_value, fired_status, delivery_status

- Performance Optimization:
  * Time-based partitioning strategies
  * Composite indexes on timestamp + instrument_id
  * Query optimization for real-time data access
  * Data retention policies and cleanup procedures
```

#### FastAPI Service Foundation
```
- Core Web Service: Single process architecture
  * FastAPI application with async/await patterns
  * WebSocket endpoints for real-time streaming
  * Background task management for data ingestion
  * Health check endpoints and system status

- API Endpoint Design:
  * GET/POST /api/instruments - Instrument management
  * GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/rules - Alert rule CRUD operations
  * GET /api/alerts - Alert history and status queries
  * GET /api/health - System health and connectivity status
  * WebSocket /ws/realtime - Real-time data and alert streaming
```

### Technical Specifications
```
- Technology Stack Additions:
  * FastAPI 0.104+ for async web framework
  * SQLAlchemy 2.0+ with AsyncSession for ORM
  * SQLite with WAL mode for database
  * WebSocket support via FastAPI WebSockets

  * Circuit breaker pattern for external API calls

- Performance Requirements:
  * Tick-to-alert latency: <500ms for typical watchlist (10-15 instruments)
  * Data ingestion: 100+ ticks/second sustained throughput  
  * Database query response: <50ms for real-time queries
  * WebSocket message delivery: <100ms to connected clients
  * Memory usage: <512MB under normal load

- Security Considerations:
  * Schwab API credentials stored securely (preparation for GCSM in Phase 3)
  * SQLite database file permissions and access control
  * Rate limiting for external API calls
  * Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
  * Error handling without exposing sensitive information
```

## üîó Integration Requirements

### Backward Compatibility
```
No backward compatibility required - this is the foundation phase.
However, establish patterns that will be maintained:
- RESTful API design principles
- Consistent error response formats
- WebSocket message structure standards
- Database schema evolution practices
```

### Forward Integration (For Phase 2)
```
Must expose interfaces and patterns for Phase 2 React UI:
- RESTful API endpoints with OpenAPI documentation
- WebSocket event streaming with defined message formats
- Database schema that supports UI data requirements
- Error handling patterns that provide user-friendly messages

Specific API Contracts for Phase 2:
- GET /api/instruments - Return all monitored instruments with status
- POST /api/rules - Accept alert rule creation with validation
- GET /api/alerts?limit=50&offset=0 - Paginated alert history
- WebSocket events: tick_update, alert_fired, health_status, rule_triggered
```

### Cross-Phase Communication
```
Data Flow Architecture:
- Schwab API ‚Üí Data Ingestion Service ‚Üí SQLite Database
- Alert Engine subscribes to data changes ‚Üí Evaluates rules ‚Üí Fires alerts
- WebSocket Service broadcasts real-time updates to connected clients
- All services share common database connection and models

Event Handling Patterns:
- Async event queues for decoupling data ingestion from processing
- WebSocket broadcasting for real-time UI updates
- Database triggers for alert rule evaluation optimization

Error Handling Framework:
- Structured error responses with error codes and user messages
- Circuit breaker patterns for external API resilience
- Graceful degradation when external services unavailable
- Error logging and monitoring for operational visibility
```
