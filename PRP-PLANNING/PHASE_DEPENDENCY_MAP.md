## ðŸ“ˆ Development Optimization

### Parallel Development Opportunities
```
Parallel Opportunity 1:
Components: Schwab API Integration and SQLite Database Design
Phases: Phase 1 (parallel development)
Dependencies: Both depend on instrument specification but not on each other
Benefit: 2-3 weeks timeline compression
Challenge: Integration complexity when combining data flow

Parallel Opportunity 2:
Components: React Component Library and API Client Development
Phases: Phase 1 (API contracts) and Phase 2 (component development)
Dependencies: Component development can start with API contract specs
Benefit: 1-2 weeks timeline compression
Challenge: Potential rework if API contracts change during Phase 1

Parallel Opportunity 3:
Components: Slack Integration and Google Cloud Secret Manager Setup
Phases: Phase 3 (parallel integration development)
Dependencies: Both require Phase 1/2 foundation but not each other
Benefit: 1 week timeline compression
Challenge: Security coordination between both integrations
```

### MVP Fast Track Option
```
MVP Phase 1: Core data + basic alerts only - 3-4 weeks (vs 5-6 weeks full)
MVP Phase 2: Essential dashboard only - 2-3 weeks (vs 4-5 weeks full)  
MVP Phase 3: In-app notifications only - 2 weeks (vs 4-5 weeks full)
Total MVP Timeline: 7-9 weeks vs 13-16 weeks full project

Deferred to Post-MVP:
- Advanced alert rule types (crossovers, rate-of-change)
- Slack and sound notifications (keep in-app only)
- Advanced UI features (export, advanced filtering)
- Google Cloud Secret Manager (use local encrypted storage)
- Advanced error handling and circuit breakers
```

### Dependency Reduction Opportunities
```
Current Dependency: Phase 3 â†’ Phase 2 (Complete UI system)
Proposed: Phase 3 â†’ Phase 2 (Basic dashboard + alert rules only)
Benefit: Phase 3 notification development can start 2-3 weeks earlier
Implementation: Define minimal UI contract for notification integration

Current Dependency: Phase 4 â†’ Phase 3 (All security features)
Proposed: Phase 4 â†’ Phase 3 (Basic security + monitoring hooks)
Benefit: Performance optimization can start before full security hardening
Implementation: Separate security hardening from performance work
```
